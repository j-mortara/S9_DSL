## Launching the examples

The examples are in the sandbox of the project.
To launch them you must open this folder with mps, then you must right-click on the language and click on `Rebuild Language 'ArduinoMl'`.

Once done you can right-click on a scenario and and click on `Preview Generated Text` to view the arduino code generated by the *DSL*.
